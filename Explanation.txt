Given a set of keywords words and a string S, make all appearances of all keywords in S bold. Any letters between <b> and </b> tags become bold.
The returned string should use the least number of tags possible, and of course the tags should form a valid combination.
For example, given that words = ["ab", "bc"] and S = "aabcd", we should return "a<b>abc</b>d". Note that returning "a<b>a<b>b</b>c</b>d" would use more tags, so it is incorrect.

Note:
words has length in range [0, 50].
words[i] has length in range [1, 10].
S has length in range [0, 500].
All characters in words[i] and S are lowercase letters.

Input Description:
First line contains, N and S. (1<N<100)
Second line contains, N elements of strings in array.
